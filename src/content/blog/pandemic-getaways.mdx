I have not felt at all safe travelling by plane during the pandemic. Besides, longer vacations are not recommended by the CDC, so I have taken a series of trips when practical throughout our great State of California.

I was furloughed from work for a week in June, so I headed to Southern California. Managed to get a beachfront hotel room in Laguna Beach.

Nature carries on during the pandemic...

Other trips to the Bay Area provided some relief from the awfulness of the pandemic.

A weekend at the St. Regis San Francisco was highlighted by a visit next door to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

A shop window in Palm Springs provided some welcome comic relief:

My dear friend Jimmy Reynolds stopped by on my birthday with a gorgeous cake from Freeport Bakery.
Grateful more than ever to be alive for another year!
