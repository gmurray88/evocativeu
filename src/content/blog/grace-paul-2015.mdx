Fantastic show by Grace Jones - une artiste provacatrice nonpareille. Forget Madonna, Miley, et al.
Miss Grace is the real deal!

Entire show performed topless, if you don't count body paint. And yes that's a dildo worn doing "My Jamaican Guy."

Still looking fabulous at 67! So much more than sexy accoutrements - superb song choice, couture and staging.

The great Paul Weller at the Fillmore in San Francisco. Tonight showcased the incredible range of his music - Pop, Rock, Psychedelia,  Funk, and more.

From teen wunderkind leading The Jam to middle-aged rocker releasing fab new music. Still at the top of his game after 40 years!
