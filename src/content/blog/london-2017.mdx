In London for virtual reality conference. Booked a standard room at the new Citizen M, which was not that photogenic, but the view across the Thames of the Tower of London was amazing.

Most of the visit was taken up by the conference. I did spend a delightful evening with my cousin Chloe and her boyfriend Tom.

It was interesting seeing the European view of virtual reality and meeting fellow enthusiasts, though somewhat odd hearing many presenters commenting on the provincial VR scene in Europe compared to the burgeoning scene in my home state of California.
