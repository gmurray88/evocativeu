Rotterdam, Holland, has some of the best modern architecture in Europe, partly due to tragedy. The city was heavily bombed in World War II. The resulting devastation allowed for the current proliferation of modern masterpieces.

I stayed at the Mainport Design Hotel in Rotterdam, Holland. My corner room came with a panoramic view, a jacuzzi, and sauna.

All for half the price of a comparable room in Amsterdam. And perfectly situated for day trips to The Hague and Amsterdam.
