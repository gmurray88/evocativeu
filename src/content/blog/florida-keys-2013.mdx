Arriving at my rental house on Ramrod Key in the Florida Keys, I spotted an iguana on the dock and an alligator in the canal. Welcome to Florida. It was a rainy week, thanks to Tropical Storm Andrea. I had planned on visiting in May, but was not able to get away from work until early June, the beginning of hurricane season. I made the most of the sultry weather by immersing myself one day in the lush flora of the Key West Tropical Forest and Botanical Garden.
