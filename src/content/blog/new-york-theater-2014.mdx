My name is Glenn and I am a theater addict.

Friday evening - Its Only A Play
Had to see this one from Front Row Center to absorb the star power: 
Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, Megan Mullaly, Matthew Broderick, F. Murray Abraham, Rupert Grint

Saturday matinee - Book of Mormon
Funniest show ever!!! Not mean-spirited, actually very sweet, which came as something as a surprise coming from the boys of South Park.

Saturday evening - Cabaret
The incomparable Alan Cummings and Emma Stone freshly debuting on Broadway. Girl can act! Emma too!
Studio 54 converted into a nightclub - The Kit Kat Club. Second table from center stage.

Sunday matinee - The Real Thing, by Tom Stoppard
Ewan McGregor's Broadway debut, opposite Maggie Gyllenhall and Cynthia Nixon

Sunday evening - The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time
"Be prepared to have all your emotional and sensory buttons pushed, including a few you may have not known existed. About an autistic boyâ€™s coming-of-age.
'I see everything. Most other people are lazy. They never look at everything.' 
The pulsating show that surrounds him insists that we feel as fully as possible both the privilege and the penalty of seeing everything." (Ben Brantley, New York Times). 

I exist somewhere on the spectrum myself, and this show changed my life. It all makes sense now, how I experience the world differently than most. Truly a privilege and a penalty.

Monday evening - Here Lies Love
Original musical - by David Byrne and Fatboy Slim - about Imelda Marcos (!).
The backdrop is Phillipines history from the 50's thru Marcos' fall in the 80's after Ninoy Aquino's assassination and subsequent People's Revolution. Much more truthful and danceable than Evita, to which it cannot escape comparison. Kudos to David Byrne for keeping it real and making us move - literally. Those of us on the main floor were tasked with periodically moving the Public Theater stage to present the show from different angles. Manual labor made a lot more fun with a hugely danceable beat.
